## Problem Statement

Escalating stress, anxiety, and burnout plague high-pressure environments‚Äîsuch as coaching institutes, schools, and corporate workplaces‚Äîand significantly disrupt daily life. Existing solutions are impersonal and disconnected from cultural roots, while scalability remains a major challenge in monitoring large groups. Without an integrated wellness approach that fuses Ayurveda, Yoga, and modern mental health practices, individuals struggle to achieve balanced well-being.
